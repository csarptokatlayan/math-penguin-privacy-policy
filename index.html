  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not collect any personal information</strong> such as names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, or any form of personally identifiable data.</p>

    <li>Game performance metrics (e.g., level progress, session length, crash reports)</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage statistics (e.g., how often the app is opened, which features are most used)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of this data is collected in aggregate form and cannot be used to personally identify any individual user.</p>

No targeted advertising is displayed, and <strong>no personal information is used to personalize ad content</strong>. The ads shown are based solely on generic context and not on user behavior or identity.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app fully complies with the <strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> and similar global data protection regulations. Since we do not collect any personal data, parents and guardians can be confident that their children’s privacy is protected at all times.</p>
